                    <p className="text-[32px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-8 font-semibold text-[#FB8A2E]">1. Types of Information We Collect</p>

                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-2">We collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Aggregate Information.</p>

                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for an account, downloading or purchasing a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.</p>

                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">Examples may include your first and last name, email address, billing address (including ZIP code), IP address, and other identifying information.</p>
                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">Aggregate Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site and what other sites may have directed you to us. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.</p>

                    <p className="text-[32px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-8 font-semibold text-[#FB8A2E]">2. How We Collect and Use Information</p>

                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be required to provide certain PII to us when you elect to use certain products or services available on the Site. These may include: (a) registering for an account on our Site; (b) entering a sweepstakes or contest sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c) signing up for special offers from selected third parties; (d) sending us an email message; or (e) submitting a form or transmitting other information by telephone or letter. When processing certain information, we encrypt the transaction, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, in order to prevent your PII from being stolen or intercepted.</p>
                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">We may also collect certain Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information.</p>

                    <p className="text-[32px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-8 font-semibold text-[#FB8A2E]">3. Cookies</p>
                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">Depending on how you use our Site, we may store cookies on your computer in order to collect certain aggregate data about our users and to customize certain aspects of your specific user experience. A cookie is a small data text file which is stored on your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies may also include more personalized information, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and ZIP code associated with your server, and your first name to welcome you back to our Site. We may use cookies to perform tasks such as: monitoring aggregate site usage metrics, storing and remembering your passwords (if you allow us to do so), storing account and advertising preferences that you have set, and personalizing the Services we make available to you. However, we do not use cookies to track your browsing behaviors. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some aspects of the Site may not function properly if you elect to disable cookies.</p>

                    <p className="text-[32px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-8 font-semibold text-[#FB8A2E]">4. Release of Information</p>
                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">We will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others. We do provide some of our products and services through contractual arrangements made with affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties (“Service Partners”). We and our Service Partners may need to use some PII in order to perform tasks between our respective sites, or to deliver products or services to you. We will encourage our Service Partners to adopt and promote strong privacy policies. However, the use of your PII by our Service Partners is governed by the respective privacy policies of those providers, and is not subject to our control. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other Sites accessible through this Site, including our Advertising and Service Partners, have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each Site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>
                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">Occasionally, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide PII to the appropriate governmental authorities. In such cases, we will disclose PII upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">We may also provide Aggregate Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any PII.</p>

                    <p className="text-[32px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-8 font-semibold text-[#FB8A2E]">5. Updating and Correcting Information</p>
                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the PII that you have provided to us. You may change any of your PII in your account online at any time by linking to your account in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this Site. You may also access and correct your personal information and privacy preferences by emailing us at</p>

Also, depending on your location, you may have certain additional rights with respect to your information such as deletion (including the right to have the Company delete your personal information, except information we are required to retain, by contacting us at the address listed above), or we may delete your data if we are instructed to do so by our customers who export your personal information to us, except for information we are required to retain; and withdrawal of consent or object to processing (including, in limited circumstances, the right to ask the Company to stop processing your personal data, by contacting us at the address listed above).</p>

                    <p className="text-[32px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-8 font-semibold text-[#FB8A2E]">6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</p>
                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-4">We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes. Also, depending on your location, you may have certain additional rights with respect to your information such as deletion (including the right to have the Company delete your personal information, except information we are required to retain, by contacting us at the address listed above), or we may delete your data if we are instructed to do so by our customers who export your personal information to us, except for information we are required to retain; and withdrawal of consent or object to processing (including, in limited circumstances, the right to ask the Company to stop processing your personal data, by contacting us at the address listed above).</p>

                    <p className="text-[32px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-8 font-semibold text-[#FB8A2E]">7. Security of Your PII</p>


                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-2">At our Site you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current industry standards. We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your PII. For example:</p>
                    
                    <div className="px-12 mt-10">
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[22px] tracking-widest mt-2">
                            <li className="mb-2">
                            We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable, accurate, complete and current. We encrypt all PII, in order to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us. We also only keep collected information indefinitely and use it only for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
                            </li>
                            <li className="mb-2">
                            We limit access to PII only to specific employees, contractors and agents who have a reasonable need to come into contact with your information. For example, we may provide members of our technical support team with limited access to your account in order to allow them to troubleshoot problems you may be having with the Site.
                            </li>
                            <li className="mb-2">
                            We also employ a number of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect PII. Our secure servers and our data centers are protected by industry-standard encryption, and our servers reside behind firewalls and employ high-level password protection.
                            </li>
                            <li className="mb-2">
                            Finally, access by you to your PII is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>

                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-10">Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.</p>

                    <p className="text-[32px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-8 font-semibold text-[#FB8A2E]">8. Third Party Services</p>


                    <p className="text-[22px] tracking-widest text-justify mt-2">We may allow you to connect a YouTube channel to your account on the Site.
